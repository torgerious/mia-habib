                <p>Over the last 20 years Mia Habib’ work and research has, with Mia Habib Productions and her team of collaborators, been entering into different contexts ranging from dance houses, opera stages and galleries to public spaces, private houses, religious buildings, squats, contexts of protest and areas of conflict, the world over. The work has taken the form of a mirror installation on the border fence between the US and Mexico, a solo in the mountains of Iraq, a healing dance in someone’s living room in northern Norway or as a large group piece for 68 people on an opera stage. She looks for spaces where her work can interact with different audiences and with the realities of local communities.
                    Habib is interested in work that engages in wide conversations and speaks about concerns of our time in different spaces. Spaces understood as being bodies, physical environments, contexts, communities and people. This is all contextualized within the political, social and artistic sphere in private, domestic and public spaces.
                    Mia Habib Productions engages in and facilitates labs and research with a variety of specialists including artists, scientists, political activists and others

                <h3>SWEET & TENDER COLLABORATIONS</h3>
                <p>Since 2004, it has been particularly important for Mia Habib Productions to seek out and support "grassroots-driven festivals”, artist-driven initiatives and underground initiatives in different parts of the world.</p>
                <p>Since 2006 Habib has been a part of the artist collective Sweet & Tender collaborations (S&T) which is an international group of individual artists that do not share a single artistic value or aesthetic, but are instead organized around an idea for artistic collaboration and production. S&T operate on the idea that any individual who can create the conditions for their own artistic production and development can also create the space for someone else. It is the idea that a network of individuals can combine their resources to realize a level of access, mobility and growth that would not otherwise be available to each artist alone. This idea underlies much of Habib´s work and since 2004 she has worked to connect dance artists to each other. This way of working is also reflected in the upcoming projects of Mia Habib Productions which include large groups of amateurs in various countries, dance artists from all over the world and guests who are invited into projects. These plans focus on networks of people who connect across projects, geography and background.</p>
                <h3>MORE ABOUT THE WORK OF MIA HABIB PRODUCTIONS</h3>
                <p>How to protest, how to touch, how to fall, how to rise, how to hope, how to choose, how to dream, how to fight, how to meet, how to continue, how to share, how to change</p>
                <p>These are questions guiding the artistic research in the coming years. In a time characterized by great uncertainty, protests around the world and population movements, Habib continues, together with other invited artists, the investigations into the physical forces that are set in motion through the large mass movements, the investigations into hospitality as well as her work with ritual practices, spaces for gathering and communities into new meetings with more people and geographies.</p>
                <p>The projects often dissolve the boundaries between the research, production and performance phases and allow these to take place simultaneously. Furthermore, the boundaries between performer, audience, participant and discussion partner are often blurred and bleed into each other.</p>

                <h3>CURATORIAL WORK</h3>
                <p>Among Habib´s curatorial practices is her work with Stranger Within together with Jassem Hindi, where their ongoing research weaves in the work of other artists and shown in galleries, in their publications and social frameworks of hosting.
                    Other curatorial work includes:
                    Together with Jassem Hindi, Habib curated “Oslohendelser” – a series of six performative happenings in public space all over Oslo during the fall of 2021 with six different artists/ artist initiatives. Hindi and Habib were invited as guest curators by Transcultural Art Productions and Kloden theater.

                    Habib curated in 2019 together with choreographers Sudesh Adhana and Elle Sofe Sara the one-day programme, "Untaming tradition”, under the frame of Oslo International Dance festival/CODA. Presenting their own works and those of other artists, they seeked to encourage open discussions concerning identity politics, social issues and political voices.( <a href="https://codadancefest.no/en/events/untaming-tradition/">https://codadancefest.no/en/events/untaming-tradition/</a>
                </p>
                <p>On the occasion of Dance House Oslo 10 year jubilee in 2018 the seminar “The Artist, the Institution and the Future of Dance” was an initiative from Dance House Oslo to discuss the current situation of dance artists and its institutions and together orientate towards the future. The seminar was developed by Solveig Styve Holte in collaboration with Per Roar and Mia Habib</p>
                <p>In 2014 Mia Habib had the artistic direction of “BrainDance”, together with Monica Gillette: a collaborative research project that brought together choreographers, neuroscientists, physicians, philosophers and people with Parkinson's disease. Produced by: Theatre Freiburg and University of Freiburg.</p>
                <p>In 2012 Habib curated the New Dance Project, Machol Hadash, in Jerusalem at the HaZira Performance Art Arena together with dance researcher Iris Lana. The project provided young choreographers with professional guidance, production assistance and financial support.</p>
                <p>In 2009 Habib initiated and facilitated the Sweet & Tender format «living house» at Dance House Oslo. For eight days, 12 international artists from Sweet & Tender, 7 students from the Norwegian Theatre Academy in Fredrikstad and 3 Norwegian dance artists occupied the house living and working there, making it an extension of a living room for both artists and audiences. The project was about re-contextualizing their (artists and audiences) relation to a production house (Dance house) by blurring the boundaries of a living space and a working space.</p>
